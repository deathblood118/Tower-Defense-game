Script Breakdown
Tower Properties: These variables define the tower's basic characteristics, such as its attack range, speed, damage, and cost. We can adjust these values to balance the game or create different types of towers.

Targeting Mechanism: The script uses Godot's signal system to detect when an enemy enters or exits the tower's range (defined by a CollisionShape2D attached to the Area2D). The tower targets the first enemy that enters its range and loses the target when it exits.

Attack Functionality: The attack function simulates attacking the targeted enemy. It's called at intervals based on the tower's attack speed. We'll need to implement the actual attack logic, such as reducing the enemy's health.

Signals for Enemy Detection: The script uses body_entered and body_exited signals to track when potential targets enter or exit the attack range. This mechanism helps in deciding when to start or stop attacking.

Customization Ideas
Multiple Targets: Modify the targeting system to handle multiple enemies simultaneously, useful for area-of-effect (AoE) towers.
Special Abilities: Implement special abilities for towers, like slowing enemies, splash damage, or temporary buffs to nearby towers.
Upgrades: Add functionality to upgrade towers, improving their range, damage, or adding new abilities.
Animations and Effects: Integrate animations or particle effects for attacks, making the game more visually appealing.
