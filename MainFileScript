    spawn_timer: A Timer node used to manage the spawning of enemies at regular intervals. Adjust the wait_time for faster or slower spawns.
    
    _ready() Function: Initializes the game. It's a good place to set up your game environment, initialize variables, or start the spawn timer.
    
    _process(delta) Function: Called every frame and can be used to update game logic that needs to check or change every frame.
    
    setup_spawn_timer() Function: Sets up and starts the timer for spawning enemies. This modular approach keeps your code organized.
