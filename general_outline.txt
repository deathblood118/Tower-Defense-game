Main.tscn (Your main game scene)
Tower.tscn (Template scene for towers)

Main Scene Setup
Create the Main Scene: Add a Node as the root, and name it Main.
Add a TileMap (for your game map) and a Path2D (to define enemy paths).
Create UI elements for displaying score, lives, and managing tower placement.

Tower Setup
Create the Tower Scene: Add a KinematicBody2D or Area2D as the root, depending on your collision detection preference, and name it Tower.
Add a Sprite for the tower's visual representation.
Attach a Script (Tower.gd) for its behavior, like targeting and attacking enemies.

Enemy Setup
Create the Enemy Scene: Similar to the tower, use KinematicBody2D or Area2D as the root, named Enemy.
Add a Sprite for the enemy.
Attach a Script (Enemy.gd) to define movement along the Path2D and interactions like taking damage.
